<h1> Making Travel Easy & Fun </h1>

	<h3><i> Patience Is Important </i></h3>
		<p> Don't sweat the stuff you can't control. Life is much too short to be angry & annoyed
				all the time. Did you bus your bus? No worries, there will be another one.

				ATMs out of money? Great! Take an unplanned road trip over to the next town and explore Sometimes
				freakouts happen regardless. </p>
		<p><strong> Just take a deep breath and remind yourself that it could be worse! </strong> </p>

	<h3><i> Wake Up Early To Avoid Crowds </i></h3>
		<p> Rise before sunrise to have the best attractions all to yurself while avoiding large tourist crowds.
				It's also a magical time for photos due to soft diffused light, and it's usually easier to interact
				with locals getting ready for their day. </p>
		<p> Want those postcard Instagramm shots? You need to get out there before everyone else shows up. Sketchy
				areas are less dangerous in the morning too. </p>

	<h3><i> Observe Daily Life Around You </i></h3>
		<p> If you really want to get a feel for the pulse of a place, spend a few hours sitting in a park or on a
				busy street corner by yourself just watching day to day life happen in front of you. </p>
		<p> Slow down your train of thought and pay close attention to the details around you. The smells, the colors,
				human interactions, and sounds. It's a kind of meditation - and you will see stuff you never noticed before. </p>

	<h3><i> Slow Down To Enjoy Your Trip </i></h3>
		<p> Don't try to cram 6 countries into 6 weeks of travel. All the good stuff happens when you really take
				time to explore. You will learn about activities that aren't in your guidebbook and meet people who are eager to show you around. </p>
		<p> Spend more time in fewer places for maximum enjoyment! </p>

	<h3><i> Take Lots of Epic Travel Photos </i></h3>
		<p> Pay attention. You may only see these places & meet these people once in your lifetime. Remember them forever
				with plenty of photos! Don't worry about looking like a "tourist". Great photos are the ultimate souvenirs. </p>
		<p> They don't cost anything, they are easy to share, and they don't take up space in your luggage. Take plenty of photos
				of yourself too, they'll be more important than your postcard shots later. Just remember that once you get your shot, it is
				important to get out from behind the lens and actually <strong>enjoy the view!</strong>

	<h3><i> Break Out of Your Comfort Zone </i></h3>
		<p> Challenge yourself to <strong>try things that normally give you anxiety.</strong> The more you do this, the more that
				anxiety will fade away. Not a hiker? Go on more hikes. Have trouble talking to strangers? Talk to everyone. Scared of
				weird food? Eat the weirdest thing you can find.</p>
		<p> The reason this works so well while traveling is because everything is already so different, whatâ€™s one more new
				or uncomfortable experience? No one knows who you are out here, you can totally reinvent yourself.</p>
